" You can override any of these settings on a global basis via the
" "/etc/vim/vimrc.local" file, and on a per-user basis via "~/.vimrc". You may
" need to create these.

" {{{ General settings
" The following are some sensible defaults for Vim for most users.
" We attempt to change as little as possible from Vim's defaults,
" deviating only where it makes sense
set nocompatible        " Use Vim defaults (much better!)
set bs=2                " Allow backspacing over everything in insert mode
set ai                  " Always set auto-indenting on
set history=50          " keep 50 lines of command history
set ruler               " Show the cursor position all the time

set viminfo='20,\"500   " Keep a .viminfo file.

" Don't use Ex mode, use Q for formatting
map Q gq

" When doing tab completion, give the following files lower priority. You may
" wish to set 'wildignore' to completely ignore files, and 'wildmenu' to enable
" enhanced tab completion. These can be done in the user vimrc file.
set suffixes+=.info,.aux,.log,.dvi,.bbl,.out,.o,.lo

" When displaying line numbers, don't use an annoyingly wide number column. This
" doesn't enable line numbers -- :set number will do that. The value given is a
" minimum width to use for the number column, not a fixed size.
if v:version >= 700
  set numberwidth=3
endif
" }}}

" {{{ Modeline settings
" We don't allow modelines by default. See bug #14088 and bug #73715.
" If you're not concerned about these, you can enable them on a per-user
" basis by adding "set modeline" to your ~/.vimrc file.
